## `Asset manager`

My First web3 backend program.
Sample project for a Wallet/Asset Managing system for multiple onchain users.

# Basic Features
User recieves unique identities (basically Principals) to serve as Wallet addresses.
Implemented a simple signup/login system that allows access to core functionality of the manager.
Allowed for onchain transfers between users.
Implemented a mini 'scans' feature, that allows users view owners and wallet addresses of onchain users without access to private data.
Allows for registry of new tokens.
